## About SOLAS

One of the core principles of software engineering is “Do not reinvent the wheel”, which
implies that programmers should avoid spending effort solving problems that other
programmers have already solved. It is a common occurrence for programmers to reuse
code to reduce development cost and time. These codes would be available in the form
of programming libraries. A programming library is a collection of non-volatile
resources used by computer programs, which may consist of pre-written code, classes,
configuration data and documentation. Software Development Library Discovery
Assistant System (SOLAS) is a web-based application that would offer a centralized
way of discovering, evaluating, choosing, and promotion of programming libraries. In
addition to searching for third-party programming libraries, users can upload their own
programming libraries for others to use. A survey has been conducted with Software
Developers and Programmers which affirms SOLAS’ usefulness as utility for
programmers to discover, evaluate and choose programming libraries.
